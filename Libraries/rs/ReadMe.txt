- Maybe rename. There already exists a lib with the name dynsys:
  https://github.com/artemyk/dynpy/blob/master/dynpy/dynsys.py  
  https://pypi.org/project/dynsys/
  Although, we have wrapped it in the rs "namespace", so maybe it's fine. 

- But maybe "rs" is not a good name. Maybe use ropt for Rob's Python Tools - Nope
  ...already taken for robust optimization. rspl (Robin Shmidts Python Library)
  or rospyl or ropyl ropyt (robs python tools) rospyt rospyl ..I think, I like
  rospyt...rospys (..stuff) rospu (..utilities..) rops (Rob's Python stuff), rspl (..python library
  ...taken. RoPyL
