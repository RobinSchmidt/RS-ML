Types of activation functions:
-tanh, sigmoid/logistic, (leaky) ReLU, ELU, Swish, step, hardclip, ...
-The softmax function is sometimes lumped in with the activation functions as well - but it's 
 different. It's not a univariate function. It's vector valued with vector input. ..dunno what that
 implies for backprop - the algo may have to be modified to account for that (not sure).
