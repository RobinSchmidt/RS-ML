Setting up the working environment:

-Install Anaconda (Python distribution) from https://www.anaconda.com/download
-Install Jupyter Lab (Web based notebook interface) from https://jupyter.org/install


On Windows, Anaconda gets by default installed into
 C:\Users\[UserName]\anaconda3
-The installer does not create desktop icons (WTF!). One has to start it from the start menu. 
  ToDo: Figure out hwo to manually create the desktop icons. It seems like the start-menu entries 
  trigger python scripts located in the "Scripts" folder of the anaconda installation

It will also install Anacond Navigator - but i have no idea which .exe I need to start



On Ubuntu:
-Start Menu -> System -> Muon Package Manager ...nope - doesn't find anaconda
-But maybe on Linux, it's better to install vanilla python and the packages manually
 spyder and jupyter are available

Python libraries:
numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib, tensorflow ...



Maybe not necessarily required but beneficial:

Anaconda Navigator
https://www.anaconda.com/products/navigator

Maybe create an account on anaconda.com in order to get access to Anaconda cloud services like 
"Notebooks" and "Assistent"

The Spyder IDE:  https://www.spyder-ide.org/
The PyCharm IDE: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/  (Payware, subscription based - open source
                 projects my be eligible for a free license)

Installing packages:

https://www.machinelearningplus.com/machine-learning/setup-python/
https://pythonspeed.com/articles/conda-vs-pip/
-ToDo:
 -Figure out what that environment.yml file is that gets mentioned there.  Do I need it? If so, 
  where should I put it and what should be its content?

After installing anaconda, maybe follow this:
https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/getting-started/

Question: Should I primarily use Jupyter, Spyder, PyCharm, VS Code or Visual Studio? See:

Working in Spyder:

-Setting up the environment:
 -Via View -> Panes, one can select the windows/panes that are shown
 -In the top right corner, there's a button to "Undock" one fo the panes to allow it to be moved 
  around. But more important is the "Unlock position" option which allows to drag the pane around 
  and dock it elsewhere
 -Via View -> Window Layouts, one can choose between different default layouts
 -I prefer a layout that is close the Matlab layout, so to set it up, do:
  -Go to View -> Window Layouts -> Matlab Layout
  -Unlock the bottom-center "Console" window, move it to the bottom-right docker, lock it again
  -Save the layout via View -> Window layouts -> Save current layout (Give it a recognizable name)
 -With F11, one can swithc to fullscreen mode - which is nice
