Setting up the working environment:

-Install Anaconda (Python distribution) from https://www.anaconda.com/download
-Install Jupyter Lab (Web based notebook interface) from https://jupyter.org/install



Python libraries:
numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib, tensorflow ...



Maybe not necessarily required but beneficial:

Anaconda Navigator
https://www.anaconda.com/products/navigator

Maybe create an account on anaconda.com in order to get access to Anaconda cloud services like 
"Notebooks" and "Assistent"

The Spyder IDE:  https://www.spyder-ide.org/
The PyCharm IDE: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/  (Payware, subscription based - open source
                 projects my be eligible for a free license)

Installing packages:

https://www.machinelearningplus.com/machine-learning/setup-python/
https://pythonspeed.com/articles/conda-vs-pip/
-ToDo:
 -Figure out what that environment.yml file is that gets mentioned there.  Do I need it? If so, 
  where should I put it and what should be its content?

After installing anaconda, maybe follow this:
https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/getting-started/

Question: Should I primarily use Jupyter, Spyder, PyCharm, VS Code or Visual Studio? See:
