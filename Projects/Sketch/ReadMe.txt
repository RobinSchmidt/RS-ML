This folder is the place for sketchy draft, throwaway and garbage code that I'm currently 
experimenting with. It is my construction yard. The stuff in here may be messy, preliminary, 
prototypical, inefficient, poorly documented, etc. It's not really intended for public consumption. 
Once some script or experimental function or module reaches a certain level of usefulness and 
maturity, it may be moved into one of the other folders.
